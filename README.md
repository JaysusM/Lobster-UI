## What is?

Lobster UI is a simple React's Component Library that will allow people to create apps in a easier way. <br/>
I will be updating the Components and fixing bugs every time I have free time. It's a long time project.

## Storybook
I created a Documentation tool using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) that shows how the components are used and how they look like. You can check it out here: https://jaysusm.github.io/Lobster-UI-Storybook/.


## Motivation
I created this library to test my React and CSS Knowledge, and because I think it will be useful for me to use in the future. It's been like a challenge, creating my own UI Components, coding beatiful and reusable components that can be used in multiple context.


## NPM Library
The library is published in npmjs.com you take a look and install it from there: https://www.npmjs.com/package/lobster-ui


## Installation
With npm:
`npm i lobster-ui`

With yarn:
`yarn add lobster-ui`
